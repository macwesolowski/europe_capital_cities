The Capital Cities of Europe Game

A simple project (Quiz) with the use of Turtle and Pandas libraries.

The code consists of while loops and "if" conditionals. It also uses data from a csv file and writes data to a different csv file.

The user has to guess 49 capital cities in Europe in English. When he gets the right answer the city is placed on the map.
